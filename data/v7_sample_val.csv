 Attached below is another < ANON_NAME > that this counteparty would like 
 to have executed .   This is mainly an active Canadian counterparty ( where we 
 have all contracts executed with ECC ) but they also do business with ENA .  
 The exposures are getting significant enough where they are needing netting 
 arrangements .  
 Please take a look at this draft that they have forwarded below .   If you find 
 it unacceptable , let me know and I will communicate it to the counterparty 
 and forward ours .   They initiated this and preferred we view their "" simple "" 
 document . 
 Thanks ,

 language to the < ANON_NAME > that makes it clear that any GTC is 
 considered to be "" signed "" and "" in writing "" if they are required by the

 GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers 
 the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a 
 GTC .   Anyway , putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel 
 better .   Once you receive the PA from her why do n't you fax it to me   and I 
 will let you know if it is acceptable . 
 Also , as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday , they wanted to do a "" test "" run

 GTC .   I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product 
 description once they get their password .   I understand that you and [NAME] 
 will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the

 proposal for load based price caps .   Obviously , these arguments would also 
 apply to the ISO Board 's recent decision .

 Subject : Motion for < ANON_NAME > by CPUC 
 [NAME] : 
 cc : < ANON_NAME > 
 I have had a quick read - through of the CPUC Motion , as requested . There 
 would appear to be two salient points . 
 1 ) CPUC asks for FERC to impose strict load - differentiated price caps . These 
 would be imposed using a formula based on "" margina1 heat rates "" times an 
 index gas price . So the maximum cap would be around $ 100 and the minimum 
 could be quite low off - peak - more like $ 30 - 40 / MWh . Needless to say this 
 does not recognize the opportunity costs of power in other markets . It was 
 also completely make redundant any trading into California . The prices would 
 rise immediately to the low caps , so there would be no incentive for anyone 
 to enter into any commerical hedging arrangements . The mechanism is 
 basically similar to the old SRAC QF contracts , but without the capacity 
 payments . 
 2 ) CPUC asks that FERC require all jurisdictional generators AND marketers 
 to offer forwards contracts for a substantial portion of their capacity at 
 FERC regulated rates and conditionns for 18 - 36 months . They claim these are 
 like the UK and Australian "" vesting contracts "" , but these involved 
 significant capacity or options payments as well . CPUC request that all 
 generators and marketers should be instructed to begin preparation of 
 cost - based filings ( how this would actually work is not stated ) . 
 Needless to say the implementation of any of this would be wiping out the 
 market for up to three years , and eliminating any potential profits from 
 current long positions in the market . 
 The schemes they have proposed have numerous problems - even if the 
 objectives were desirable - so there is plenty to poke holes in . The 
 decision on whether to file any response to me would seem to be based on 
 whether these issues will be completely addressed in FERC 's order , making 
 the CPUC Motion irrelevant . If there is any chance that the CPUC could be 
 taken seriously their motion should be opposed , as the restrictions on the 
 market are quite onerous . Any players with long positions in the market 
 would stand to lose quite a bit under the proposed capped rates at these 
 levels .

 I 'm not certain that an Enron entity will provide a performance guaranty .   I 
 agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk 
 for a performance problem . 
 Is the reference to the "" State "" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA ? 
 As far as I know , the CRRA deal is still in the works , with nothing but a

 < ANON_NAME > Golden 
 NEW YORK -(<ANON_NAME>)- The credit problems of the < ANON_NAME > 
 < ANON_NAME > reflect the credit problems of the state 's three 
 investor - owned utilities , < ANON_NAME > . ( ENE ) chief of staff < ANON_NAME > said 
 Wednesday . 
 "" We have expressed some concerns about the utilities ' creditworthiness , "" [NAME] 
 said . "" They would n't have this credit issue if they had a government 
 guarantee . "" 
 Standard & Poor 's credit analyst for California utilities , < ANON_NAME > , 
 told < ANON_NAME > Newswires that such a guarantee is highly unlikely . 
 "" There 's no point in talking about it , "" [NAME] said . 
 The credit - rating agency put California utility holding companies PG&E Corp 
 ( PCG ) and < ANON_NAME > ( EIX ) on watch with negative implications 
 Wednesday . The utilities have seen their debt rating downgraded already this 
 fall , but their debts are piling up by the billions as they continue to pay 
 about 10 times more for power supplies than they can charge customers . 
 "" The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is beyond belief , "" 
 [NAME] said . "" Wholesale prices have gotten worse , and every hour the 
 situation gets more dire . "" 
 [NAME] said the only step that would save the utilities ' credit status is 
 if California regulators raised the rates the utilities can charge customers . 
 < ANON_NAME > , the < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > indicated that it 
 may do so , reversing a decision made just last week . 
 "" With new generation coming on , you would expect the rates to decline in a 
 couple of years , "" [NAME] said . 
 < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > Operator almost had to institute rolling 
 blackouts Wednesday because 13 suppliers had stopped selling it power due to 
 concerns about the ISO 's credit . 
 < ANON_NAME > . < ANON_NAME > said that Enron was one of the "" dirty 13 . "" 
 Enron 's [NAME] said that Enron was only offering very limited amounts of power 
 to the ISO . 
 "" We are basically just a buyer and seller . We control only 70 megawatts of 
 generation in the state , which we offered to the ISO today because of the 
 emergency , but the ISO declined to purchase that power , "" [NAME] said . 
 That small generating unit is located in the southern California , while the 
 ISO 's supply problems were most acute in northern California . 
 "" We are n't selling any other power to them right now . Everything else that we 
 bought we 've sold to other buyers , "" said [NAME] , who added that Enron had sold 
 to the ISO as recently as Tuesday . 
 The ISO manages California 's electricity grid and purchases last - minute 
 additional power on behalf of the state 's three investor - owned utilities . The 
 ISO then bills the utilities , which are PG&E Corp 's < ANON_NAME > & Electric 
 < ANON_NAME > International 's ( EIX ) < ANON_NAME > Edison , and Sempra 
 Energy 's ( SRE ) < ANON_NAME > Gas & < ANON_NAME > . 
 The ISO has 70 - day payment terms to suppliers . 
 For the past two weeks , and often during the summer , the ISO has been 
 purchasing about one - fourth of the state 's entire needs at very high prices . 
 It 's current daily power purchases are running at $ 50 million to $ 100 
 million ."
