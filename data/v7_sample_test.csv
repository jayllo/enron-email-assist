 [NAME] and [NAME] , 
 The following is an update we sent out to Harvard and Ospraie regarding the 
 status of our transaction pipeline .   I thought it would be of interest to 
 both of you as well . 
 Gentlemen , 
 We have sent the final version of the CA to [NAME] to be signed , hopefully 
 we will receive information either tomorrow or early next week and have a 
 preliminary valuation and structure proposal by the end of next week .    We 
 are negotiating a CA with [NAME] and they appear anxious to get started .  
 Their general counsel told me they have prepared a box of due diligence items 
 to be delivered as soon as we agree on certain terms .   The DevX CA should be 
 finalized today as well and we will get started on that prospect hopefully 
 next week also .   We are still waiting on information from Chesapeake , but I 
 spoke with < ANON_NAME > last week and he is getting his new reserve report 
 finalized and will send it to us when it ready .   [NAME] is progressing albeit 
 slowly because of the complicated nature of the structure .   We are also 
 analyzing a new transaction that another group within Enron has originated 
 and structured a VPP around but they may not have favorable financing .   It 
 could represent an opportunity for both of you to see if a small equity 
 participation in the SPV is of interest .   That 's it , call me if you have any 
 questions or comments .

 Doug , 
 I just wanted to say that you handled Hallwood perfectly . Also if it is time 
 to move on other fronts -- [NAME] / Nuevo -- I am ready to go . I think [NAME] 
 will probably be under pressure in the next few weeks after missing 4q and 
 reducing reserves .

 I am attaching a revised copy of the agreement . TVA has agreed to these 
 changes . 
 TVA supplied the basic changes and we intervened in a couple of cases where 
 we did not think they met our agreements . 
 My   comments to are as follows : 
 I believe the second bullet is better stated than the original one we 
 submitted . We support this wording . 
 In the last paragraph , if Enron also supports the wording related to ENNA and 
 ENCA we need to include your name in the sentence . 
 Please disregard the original document and let 's work from this one .

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us , we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year .   To be honest , employee feedback has been mixed .   Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season .   Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company 's current circumstances . 
 After weighing these points of view , we have ultimately decided to cancel the all - Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8 .   Given what has transpired over the past month , it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event .   I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more .   We will attempt to find other , more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season .

 Mark 
 Thanks for the call a couple of weeks ago regarding our new ad campaign .   The 
 challenge as I understand it is that we have difficulty in quantifying the 
 benefit and effectiveness of our ads .    We can measure on a periodic basis 
 what the CEO / CCO / CFO perception of Enron is on a periodic basis but this does 
 not break down the impact of our PR efforts from an ad campaign .    I 
 understand this dilemma . 
 But one thing that we could measure that is quite important to me is what our 
 employees think about these ads .     If all else fails these ads should make 
 our employees proud to work for Enron - and this is something we should be 
 able to measure on a consistent basis . 
 I know you have an upcoming event in California where your organisation will 
 talk about problems and challenges we have - so if you could consider this 
 idea I would be very appreciative .   And of course do n't get to hooked on 
 God 's country while you are in Napa . 
 Thanks !
