 Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron . I had a 
 very pleasant time there , and I found the meetings very 
 informative . 
 As discussed during my visit at Enron , I am sending you below 
 a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program 
 in place and rolling , and start the students working on it . 
 It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was 
 and how the letter should be structured . Sorry for the delay . 
 If I may , I 'd like to visit Enron again , sometime in August , 
 to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize 
 the problems to look at . I 'm in frequent contact with [NAME] , 
 who is impressed by the environment there . We are trying to formulate 
 the research issues and problems to study , that would be of interest 
 to Enron .   The plan is this : 
 1 ) By < ANON_NAME > will have been there for almost 2 months 
 and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem 
 space . 
 2 ) I will work together with [NAME] till August to formulate a set of 
 good problems of : 
 a ) high practical importance 
 b ) high innovation potential 
 c ) serious scope . 
 3 ) I could   visit in August ( say mid - August or so ) to : 
 a ) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback 
 b ) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact 
 c ) make sure we 're on the same page regarding research strategy 
 and execution path . 
 I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then , so 
 that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his 
 doctoral work in this area . 
 I 'm all excited about our collaboration . I am even thinking of 
 starting a research seminar at Stanford , specifically on these 
 research issues ! 
 Talk to you soon .

 Sorry we have played phone - tag . 
 The couple issues I wanted to talk with you about are 1 ) the reference in 
 your Dec 4 letter regarding re - enrolling customers for switching to Enron , 
 and 2 ) the listing of < ANON_NAME > as a creditor in Enron 's 
 bankruptcy filing . 
 The pending switches of the 1013 customer accounts were canceled based upon 
 our conversation last week .   This does not put them on ' hold ' for a later 
 switch , since that is not feasible or appropriate .   The customers simply 
 remain on their former rate ( < ANON_NAME > or < ANON_NAME > ) until they 
 choose otherwise .   When/<ANON_NAME > wishes to re - initiate a switch for the 
 customers , you would need to send through the appropriate EDI switch 
 transaction as usual .   If the customer has not yet chosen another supplier , 
 the switch would be processed .   We assume you 'd take care of any contract 
 updating that needed to be addressed with the customers , as that is a matter 
 between you and them .   Hope that clarifies .   Please let me know if 
 questions . 
 Have you been able to identify someone in the financial area that could 
 answer some questions on the calculations of the amounts listed under the 
 creditor section of the bankruptcy filing ?   We 'd like to speak with someone 
 ASAP .   Thanks .

Message-ID: <30266036.1075849413616.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,<|original|>,"Folks : 
 Here are my edits .   For simplicity , I accepted all the other changes and put 
 mine in strike - out - underline . 
 They are confined to the direct access section , and to the provisions 
 regarding "" spot market service "" in particular .   Based on our negotiations , I 
 think it 's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as 
 "" an option to elect . ""   Instead , the language in the agreement states that it 
 is a "" backstop , "" in the event that on any given day a customer 's ESP does n't 
 show up with the power .   In effect , it retains the utility 's duty to serve , 
 like the gas side , but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost 
 recovery for the spot service provided .   I 've also added provisions which 
 obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the 
 outset of the program ( i.e. , the transition date ) , the customer , for whatever 
 reason fails to elect < ANON_NAME > or < ANON_NAME > Service .   In both cases , 
 the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days , after which the customer 
 must choose [NAME] or < ANON_NAME > Service . 
 Please take a look at the language .   While I have n't put any "" stakes in the 
 ground "" up till now , I feel strongly about these changes ( for reasons I 'm 
 happy to discuss ) , and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the 
 document , I 'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss .   I believe 
 that the language as proposed captures my conversation with [NAME] . 
 In addition , I 've also taken a stab at language requested by [NAME] , i.e. , 
 "" what to do about DA in the interm ? ""   There may be better ways to craft the 
 language , but I took a shot nonetheless . 
 Finally , I 'm assuming , based on yesterday 's call , that , by delivering this 
 document to the Speaker today , no one is giving their approval , support , or 
 anything else for each and every provision .   I 'm not prepared to , and can not , 
 do that at this time . 
 Thanks again to all for all the effort ( and to [NAME] for her patience in 
 hearing me out earlier ) .

 These are the steps that we have taken to insure that the positions the V@R 
 engine picks up are correct : 
 1 . Each book adm . now checks his / her own positions that are going into V@R ,  
 rather than just one check at   a consolidated level . 
 2 . All regional controllers will receive a sheet at the end of the night , 
 verifying that all books are officialized ."
Message-ID: <10276405.1075862291203.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,<|original|>,"Please see the attached comparison of the Phase 6 that we have in the 2002 - 2006 Plan versus [NAME] 's analysis . 
 For the Plan , we ran it with and without Phase 6 to determine the incremental change .   The worksheet attached also shows the Returns on Equity and Capitalization ( with and without ) based on the Plan runs . 
 You will have a reasonable apples - to - apples if you compare the amounts at the < ANON_NAME > level because [NAME] did not assume how it was financed in his analysis however my depreciation is GAAP but [NAME] 's is Tax . 
 There are only two significant differences : 
 1 )   For conservatism , [NAME] used the settled rate rather than the rate refund floor rate in 2004 .   < ANON_NAME > 's calculations this made a difference of   about 2.9 cents ( 77.60 cts vs. 74.71 cts . ) for the customers other than FP&L in 2004 .   There is no difference for FP&L because their 2004 rate cap is 74.60 cts , lower than either the settled or rate refund floor rates .   ( < ANON_NAME > , in the risk analyses the rate refund floor impact WAS included . ) 
 2 )   We got a lower < ANON_NAME > tax estimate from < ANON_NAME > than what [NAME] used ."
Message-ID: <10639850.1075851033596.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,<|original|>,"Attached below please find the cash flow / tariff increase study we discussed 2 
 1/2 weeks ago at the Sunday DPC strategy session .   The study assumes a 
 decrease in losses from 40 % to 25 % and an increase in collection efficiency 
 83 % to 92 % from 2000 - 01 to 2006 - 07 .   Further , it is assumed that only one 
 block of DPC operates until 2006 - 07 .  
 Two scenarios based on average realisation are illustrated : 
 1 . A realistic cash flow study and   accompanying tariffs .   Given the above 
 assumptions and assuming there is no state subsidy in 2006 - 07 , MSEB should 
 have a cash flow deficit of [NAME] [NAME] . in 2006 - 07 when Phase II comes on line 
 for sale to MSEB , given a reasonable annual tariff increase .   ( See the tariff 
 sheet in gray shaded area . )   The annual rate increases would be15 % for LT and 
 HT agriculture and LT public water works , a 10 % increase for domestic , street 
 lights and interstate sales , a 4 % increase for LT industrial and powerloom , 
 and 1 % increase for LT commercial and HT industrial , public water works and 
 railways . 
 2 . The annual tariff increases needed for MSEB to break even with a 3 % 
 profit , assuming industrial and commercial classes are held flat , are 
 detailed below .   ( See the Tariff sheet in red . ) 
  Domestic           8 % 
  LT < ANON_NAME > Works     35.60 % 
  LT Agriculture and Poultry    26 % 
  < ANON_NAME >      10.8 % 
  HT Agricultural & Poultry     26.9 % 
  < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > Soc .   24.30 % 
  Interstate sales        6.5 % 
 It is obvious that   even the more realistic scenario would require strong 
 MSEB , state government and regulator resolve . 
 In a separate e : mail I will describe the cost of service study we have also 
 developed for MSEB .

I have n't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4 .   Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country .   Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel .   I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly .   Also sorry to hear about Mrs. [NAME]   I hope she is doing better . 
 It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place .   In fact , when they finally announced it , my primary feeling was one of relief .   Things had gotten very bad .   Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details .   At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances . 
 It 's nice you have < ANON_NAME > to get away to .   You 'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease .   It would be nice to get away from here now and then though .   I was supposed to go to Ft . Lauderdale ( did you know [NAME] was living there now ? ) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there .   That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here .   I had hoped to be in < ANON_NAME > today for a seminar ( where I was actually scheduled to speak ) but cancelled that also .   With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon .   I 'm really feeling the need for a break ( and 4 days in Cincinnati next week do n't count ) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months .

 I have your revised letter . ? There is only one thing that seems subject to

 it be revised as follows : 
 "" ..... and Transwestern 's maximum rates shall apply on a daily , volumetric 
 basis to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized . "" 
 This would reflect how I read the Tariff provisions to apply . ? As written 
 now , someone could infer that ALL volumes go to [NAME] rates whenever ANY 
 volumes are moved from / to an unspecified alternate point . ? I am visualizing a 
 nomination day with part of the volumes from [NAME] or one of these 
 specified points and part of the volumes from some other unspecified 
 alternate point . 
 Then , just a general question . ? Are any of these named alternates also 
 delivery points , as well as receipt points ? ? Are there any delivery points in

 Subject : Re : Trip to < ANON_NAME > 
 My thoughts for the trip : 
 Friday : 
 Everyone says that you have to see the zoo if you are in < ANON_NAME > .   Even- if 
 you do n't particularly like zoos .   Everything I read says that it will take 
 at least half a day .   I say we hit that Friday morning through early 
 afternoon .   Spend mid - afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be 
 shopping , etc . near there .   Then go to the game .   When we get back that 
 night- we can walk on the beach ! 
 Saturday : 
 < ANON_NAME > Park .   See the < ANON_NAME > , in other musuems / gardens in 
 the area that look interesting .   If we are n't sick of seeing animals , there 
 is suppose to be a wonderful < ANON_NAME > Park that gives trolley or walking 
 tours ( the tours are only like an hour and a half ) .   After that- there is a 
 ferry you can take across the bay to the < ANON_NAME > to see the Hotel del 
 Coronado .   It is suppose to be a really neat place .   Then- you we can finish 
 the day in the < ANON_NAME > downtown .   It is suppose to have a "" lively 
 evening street scene "" and live music . 
 What do you think ?   Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these 
 open- if we are interested .

 Subject : Support for Exotica 
 All 
 [NAME] 's investigations of Exotica 's status in London have turned up a very 
 confused state of affairs . This is n't being helped by the fact that : 
 1 . Anjam is rarely at his desk , and ca n't be found anywhere in the building . 
 2 . When he is around he is n't willing or able to provide all the information 
 Sharad might need to support Exotica .  
 This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
 Exotica 's valuations . 
 Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail , 
 and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
 these emails .  
 If things do n't improve soon , I may need to request some assistance in 
 extracting this information from Anjam . 
 Many thanks ,

Message-ID: <21076704.1075842484785.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,<|original|>,"As we 're beginning to see the second wave of Order 637 proceeding technical 
 conferences being scheduled , here is a brief update on the proposed 
 timetables for the first few dockets .   < ANON_NAME > kicks off , we are in a 
 settlement mode in all the cases , with most pipelines in informal discussions 
 with customers / parties to work towards consensus settlements that can be 
 filed with the Commission .  
 * * Note that [NAME] , adamant that segmentation is not operationally feasible on 
 its system , has circulated a settlement proposal on segmentation .   See below . 
 ANR , RP00 - 332 : 
  After three technical conferences at FERC , ANR is committed to developing a 
 total consensus document .   ANR is circulating their latest revisions to 
 customers by December 7th , and customers are meeting without the Commission 
 or the pipeline to discuss ANR 's proposal on December 15th .   A follow - up 
 technical conference at FERC is scheduled for January 11 , 2001 . 
 Dominion , RP00 - 344 : 
 Dominion has held at least five meetings with customers to work out a 
 settlement in this case .   A technical conference , originally scheduled for 
 late October , has been rescheduled with FERC Staff for December 14th .   This 
 should be a meeting on a settlement proposal . 
 [NAME] , RP00 - 340 : 
 [NAME] has circulated revisions to its Order 637 filing , including a settlement 
 proposal for segmentation .   There will be a conference call among [NAME] and 
 its customers on December 5th to get comments on the tariff revisions as 
 discussed at the October 25th technical conference and the new segmentation 
 proposal .   After that call , a follow - up technical conference at FERC should 
 be scheduled for sometime in January . 
 [ The segmentation proposal would allow customers broader supplemental rights 
 in the zones in which their primary receipt and primary delivery points are 
 located .   When points are located in different zones , the customer would be 
 entitled to utilize its full MDQ in each zone ( in essence doubling their 
 MDQ ) .    It 's critical to [NAME] 's offer that all segmented transactions will be 
 scheduled on a supplemental basis , as this is the only protection for the 
 operational integrity of its system and primary firm services of other 
 customers .   The right to segmentation can be waived by customers and it will 
 be available on a prospective basis only for new or renegotiated contracts .  
 [NAME] is also proposing a "" segmentation fee "" to be assessed either to those 
 customers utilizing segmentation or by all [NAME] customers ( undecided in the 
 proposal ) .   This fee will be used to recover all costs associated with 
 developing the segmentation program and necessary computer system . ] 
 < ANON_NAME > , RP00 - 325 : 
 CIG will circulate revisions by December 1st to its compliance filing as 
 discussed at the pipeline 's second technical conference on October 26th .  
 Parties will send comments to CIG by December 10th .   The schedule , from that 
 point , will go into January .   CIG may follow Dominion 's lead and schedule 
 settlement meetings with parties before meeting with Staff again . 
 Tennessee , RP00 - 477 : 
 Tennessee is circulating revisions based on discussions at the November 14th 
 technical conference by December 8th .   Parties will meet within two weeks of 
 that date to discuss the revisions ( either separately or at a FERC technical 
 conference ) . 
 < ANON_NAME > , RP00 - 343 : 
 < ANON_NAME > plans to circulate a revised 637 package by December 15th , with 
 a conference call scheduled for January 4th to get feedback from customers on 
 the revisions .   The pipeline believes there may not be a need for a second 
 technical conference and hopes to file a settlement and implementation plan 
 by the end of January ."

 Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates

 assuming you can still run it by the Analyst / Associate program . They closed

 day , but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant . Please let me 
 know if this plan suits you - 
 1 . You will continue to receive the same EnPower / EOL summary , complete with 
 EES sleeves . If I take the EES deals out of this table , I have to adjust the 
 total megawatts accordingly . This could end up taking awhile , and I 'm not 
 sure the effect would be worth it . Again , let me know if you agree , because 
 I 'd like this report to be as applicable as possible . 
 2 . I will run the EnPower deal count , excluding EES deals . I 'll compare this 
 count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
 desk , then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
 subtract . I 'll enter the altered numbers into the graph , which should produce 
 a more accurate rendering of the day 's activities . 
 I think I made it sound more complicated than it is . Bottom line , this should 
 solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado .

 This service is available for < ANON_NAME > and < ANON_NAME > whose service from a < ANON_NAME > provider has been interrupted , or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct < ANON_NAME > Service or < ANON_NAME > . 
 I do n't understand the meaning of the phrase "" or be deemed to elect . ""   If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose , then perhaps it 's appropriate to leave it in .   But we have n't discussed any reason for needing it .   As such , given the last - minute nature of the change , it should be deleted . 
 There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate - related language that [NAME] provided that we did n't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations .   It may turn out that it 's all fine , but I frankly have n't have n't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language , so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term . 
 Finally , I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 ( a ) ( 6 ) regarding the green portfolio standard .   We never discussed / analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a "" zone of comfort "" around including those numbers .   That may become an issue ( and may not , just wanted to briefly flag it ) .

 I appreciate the patience on the Password issue .    I realize it has been a 
 while since we first spoke about this point . 
 I have reviewed the concern about hackers and Enron use of Passwords and the 
 best we can do is insert language into the < ANON_NAME > . similar to that 
 appearing in the attached document ( which is the same type of language used 
 in the ETA 's ) .   It is intended only to cover the situation where Clickpaper

 unauthorized manner , on behalf of a counterparty .   The language does not 
 address the hacker situation as we place the burden in that situation upon 
 the counterparty . 
 Finally , since the < ANON_NAME > . is a legal , electronic agreement , any 
 amendments or modifications for a counterparty must come through my office or 
 through < ANON_NAME > ( ( x. 33399 ) .   Accordingly , those counterparties who have

 a matter of the laws of either Texas or < ANON_NAME > as to the actual nature of 
 the security interest which is created by the charge . 
 If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge , we would need 
 an original ( or a certified true copy ) of the executed document which creates 
 the security interest .   There is no time limit on such registration .  
 However , please note that , in addition to our professional fees , there is a 
 filing fee of $ 446 which is payable in respect of the registration . 
 I trust that the above is of some assistance .   If you have any questions 
 please do not hesitate to contact me .

 rent it to a single guy ... Maybe you need a little winter getaway ? ?

 maintaining , and publishing standards that promote reliable and 
 efficient wholesale electricity markets throughout < ANON_NAME > .   Such 
 standards would address , in an integrated way , the whole spectrum of 
 reliability , market interface , and business practice standards through a 
 fair , open , balanced , and inclusive stakeholder process . 
 < ANON_NAME > 19 , the < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > ( FERC ) issued 
 an < ANON_NAME > Guidance on the Formation of a < ANON_NAME > 
 Organization for the < ANON_NAME > Industry ( < ANON_NAME > . 
 RM01 - 12 - 00 ) .   That order directs the industry to reach agreement on the 
 formation of an organization to develop consensus standards for business 
 practices and electronic communications .   If the industry can not reach 
 consensus on this issue by March 15 , the Commission indicated that it 
 will either institute its own procedures to choose an organization or 
 will develop the standards itself . 
 To provide the NERC < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > Force 
 ( SCRTF ) as well as the NERC < ANON_NAME > and Board of Trustees 
 the broadest possible input , the Board strongly urges all interested 
 parties to comment on the WESM proposal in the context of the recent 
 FERC order .   Commenters should give particular attention to how NERC and 
 the recently approved < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > Board ( NAESB ) 
 could collaborate in developing and overseeing a single , industry - based 
 consensus process to develop standards that assure the continued 
 reliable operation of the integrated < ANON_NAME > electric 
 transmission grids as well as the development of business practice 
 standards and communication protocols needed to complement the market 
 design principles that FERC has announced its intention to develop . 
 NERC 's SCRTF will use all comments received to help shape its final 
 proposal to the NERC < ANON_NAME > and Board of Trustees in 
 February 2002 .   We also intend to provide the input we receive in this 
 public forum on the WESM model to FERC for its consideration .

		  Subject : 83829/44 < ANON_NAME > re Special matter - < ANON_NAME > 
 < ANON_NAME > re : tape transcripts 
 At this time , this summary has been sent to you only . 
 Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with 
 us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in 
 exchange for our providing similar information to them . 
 He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October , 
 the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex 
 equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own 
 equipment . 
 As you are aware , the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover 
 the period of September of 1999 to the end of October . 
 The tapes which we have listened to , but which they have not seized , cover 
 the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September , 1999 . 
 With respect to the tapes that they have seized , initially we exerted a claim 
 of privilege to all of the tapes .   < ANON_NAME > has now come back to us and has 
 asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question .  
 We have volunteered to have this discussion with them , but to this point in 
 time , they have not responded to us . 
 If , as and when the conversation occurs , our position will be that we intend 
 to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only .   How this 
 particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear . 
 Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have , they are not 
 particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the 
 flavour of the matter to our benefit . 
 < ANON_NAME > of next week , we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see 
 exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau .   We will 
 advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our 
 offices and at the conclusion of this matter , we should be able to see 
 exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between 
 Powerex and Enron . 
 We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience .

 I wanted to forward you this email that I sent to [NAME] .   He had come back to [NAME] and I to resolve an issue with the dropping VaR associated with TW .   [NAME] was asking if this was related to the processes that we have automated . In speaking with Vernon , the date of the ERMS problem with the < ANON_NAME > basis discussed below happened to coincide with the date or near proximity of the unwinding the Wholesale positions that TW had held . Consequently , there were substantial changes with the VaR increasing during this period .   When the rolling price data dropped off , it rolls for 30 days , the VaR decreased substantially .   If you have any questions please give me a call .

 cc : < ANON_NAME>/HOU/<ANON_NAME > : Issue with < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > 
 [NAME] , 
 I left you a message concerning the issue with the VaR.   The problem is associated with the ERMS Price that came on December 19 .   The basis was .23 instead of -.23 .   This is represented in SJ < ANON_NAME > File below . Consequently the inclusion of this date in the rolling 30 day bucket for the < ANON_NAME > calculation essentially changed the volatility for the entire Winter 2002 - 2003 strip .   Any I - I deal involving the < ANON_NAME > was thus flawed and shown in the VaR.  
 As this did occur on December 19th , this should have been caught in the December time period for any VaR report done on a daily basis since that time .   For example , the < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > was .395 on December 17 , .394 on December 18 , .521 on December 19 and .657 on December 20 .   The VaR went up in the same way it came down-- on Feb 4 it was .66 , on Feb 5 it was .52 , on Feb 6 it was .357 and on Feb 7 it was .343 .   This is shown in the attached file < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > . 
 < ANON_NAME > and I do the base calculations , which are correct , we would never catch this mistake .   We are somewhat surprised that when this volatility was included on December 19th the VaR report did not show a substantial increase from the previous day .   In the same way the VaR dropped by half , we would have expected it to double over a period of a couple of days in that week of December . 
 All in all , this issue took 10 hours for [NAME] and I to resolve .   As it is essentially out of the perview of setting up the SAS automation process -- the process did run correctly , it was a little frustrating for us to devote the time to identifying this particular issue .   It would also appear to be a troubling issue from a financial perspective given the current Enron environment . 
 I hope this resolves the problem .

 Subject : New real options presentation 
 All 
 Attached in the latest version of my real options presentation , which I 'll be 
 presenting at a < ANON_NAME > Group conference in Cambridge next month . 
 I 've removed the gas storage pricing example , and instead put in a simple 
 example to show that my method can reproduce decision tree approaches ( should 
 one wish to do so ) .   This is a response to the heavily decision - tree 
 dominated approach taken by most people at the last conference I spoke at .   I 
 want to demonstrate explicitly that my approach covers both decision tree and 
 option pricing as special cases , the synthesis needed for correct real option 
 valuation . 
 My presentation now covers : 
 1 . Decision trees . 
 2 . Binomial option pricing trees . 
 3 . Power station valuation . 
 4 . Power asset development . 
 The option pricing and power examples are based on the ( too simplistic ) 
 binomial tree method .   I obviously wo n't indicate my thoughts on the most 
 correct way to do this .

 Connell : Power cost twice [NAME] ' figure 
 July 6 , 2001 
 By [NAME] [NAME] 
 < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > 
 SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $ 43 billion of 
 worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by 
 Gov. < ANON_NAME > ' administration , state < ANON_NAME > Connell said 
 Thursday . 
 Connell said her staff 's analysis put the per - megawatt average at $ 170 , 
 compared with $ 69 to $ 79 estimated by [NAME] . 
 Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another 
 increase in rates , although consumer groups said the higher amount likely 
 would require some future increase . 
 The controller , who writes the state 's checks , said her figures assume fixed 
 prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts , which range from a 
 few months to 20 years . 
 The administration , noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the 
 fluctuating market price of natural gas , said costs on many of the contracts 
 would decline over time . 
 Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration 's numbers . 
 "" You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages , 
 long - range or short - range contracts , peak power or nonpeak , and probably 
 either average could be defended mathematically , "" said < ANON_NAME > of The 
 < ANON_NAME > Network . "" We ca n't tell you whether it 's $ 69 or $ 170 - the 
 contracts are very convoluted and complex . """

  Subject : FW : 11 things < ANON_NAME > - worth reading 
 1 . It hurts to love 
 someone and not be loved in 
 return , But what is more 
 painful is to love someone and 
 never find the courage 
 to let that person know 
 how you feel . 
 2 .   A sad thing in life is 
 when you meet someone who means a 
 lot to you , only to find out in the end that it was 
 never meant to be and you just have to let go . 
 3 . The best kind of friend 
 is the kind you can sit on a porch 
 swing with , never say a word , and then walk 
 away feeling like it was the best conversation 
 you 've ever had . 
 4 . It 's true that we do n't know what 
 we 've got until we lose it , but 
 it 's also true that we do n't know what we 've 
 been missing until it arrives . 
 5 .   It takes only a minute 
 to get a crush on someone , an hour to 
 like someone , and a day to love someone- but it takes 
 a lifetime to forget someone . 
 6 . Do n't go for looks ; they can deceive . Do n't go 
 for wealth ; even that fades away . 
 Go for someone who makes you smile because it 
 takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright . 
 7 . Dream what you want to dream ; go where you want 
 to go ; be what you want to be , because you have only 
 one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do . 
 8 .   Always put yourself in the other 's shoes . If you 
 feel that it hurts you , it probably hurts the person too . 
 9 . A careless word may kindle strife ;   a cruel word may 
 wreck a life ; a timely word may level stress ; a loving 
 word may heal and bless . 
 10 . The happiest of people do n't necessarily have the 
 best of everything they just make the most of everything that 
 comes along their way . 
 11 . Love begins with a smile , grows with a kiss , ends with a tear . 
 When you were born , you were crying and everyone around 
 you was smiling .   Live your life so that when you die , 
 you 're the one smiling and everyone around you is crying . 
 Send this to your friends and send it back to the person who sent 
 it to you .   Print this out and keep it in your pocket or purse and 
 pull 
 it out whenever you need a hint for Life . Always remember - Life 
 is precious , do n't let it slip by ."

 y 
 [NAME] to call a special session of the California legislature to deal with= 
 skyrocketing natural gas prices . 
 & Families and businesses are reeling every month from extraordinary gas=

 asking for him to convene a special session of the legislature to deal with= 
 California , s skyrocketing natural gas bills .   Republicans delivered the= 
 letter to [NAME] this morning . 
 & A special session is both a symbolic and a practical necessity .   It tel= 
 ls 
 Californians that we care about their skyrocketing gas bills .   It tells 
 businesses everywhere that California is going to provide for its future 
 energy needs,8 said Campbell .   & Practically speaking , a special sessi= 
 on also 
 allow us to pass legislation which can take effect immediately.8 
 Republicans believe the electricity and natural gas crises are inextricably= 
 linked . 
 & California , s natural gas crisis is completely intertwined with its= 
 electricity crisis,8 said Campbell .   & Any plan to deal with our elect= 
 ricity 
 crisis must have a natural gas component or Californians are going to pay= 
 unacceptably high prices for both.8

 which could be addressed comprehensively by a special session . 
 & Natural gas issues include pipeline capacity , storage , exploration , 
 alternative fuels and conservation,8 said Campbell .   & A special sessi= 
 on lets 
 us put together a comprehensive solution.8 
 & The private sector has the expertise and the capital to deal with these= 
 issues if government would just get out of the way .   Republicans believe th= 
 at 
 a legislative solution to the natural gas crisis should leave the resources= 
 and primary decision - making to the private sector,8 said Campbell .

 I thought that it would be easier to e - mail you since we keep missing each 
 other on the phone .   All of the St. Clair 's are doing well .   [NAME] keeps 
 growing .   At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches .  
 Needless to say he likes to eat .   He is gradually starting to sleep more at 
 night but is still pretty unpredictable and I 've just gotten used to not 
 getting alot of sleep .   < ANON_NAME > home with me is a big help and it makes 
 it alot easier for me since we can trade off . 
 Physically , I am feeling almost 100 % .   I started running a few weeks ago just 
 to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going 
 to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape .   [NAME] is very 
 much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play .   He played in 
 his first tournament over the weekend and did very well .   [NAME] and I are 
 hoping that he keeps it up .   He has been great with the baby as I expected .  
 He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him .   I feel 
 very , very fortunate . 
 How are you doing and how are the boys ?   I miss work and the interaction with 
 everyone , but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home .   I think that 
 you know how I must feel and I 'm glad that I still have some time to think 
 about it .   I ca n't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just 
 beginning to feel good physically .   < ANON_NAME > . Clair 
 [NAME] is back in school and is a big help at home .   I 'm enjoying being home 
 with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him 
 while he is in school . 
 I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there .   How are 
 your parents doing ?   Please give them my best .   I keep promising to come up 
 for a visit and I will soon .   Tomorrow ( Thursday ) may be a possibility .   Hope 
 to see you soon .   Take care .

 Please give me a report following your fly - over of the route with [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] .   I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
 there .   Do n't forget to take your camera .   Pictures ( slides ) would be most 
 helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
 portion .   As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates , we will 
 need to develop some preliminary maps .   It is my understanding that no maps 
 of the route will be released with sign - off from the entire group of : Hyatt , 
 < ANON_NAME > and [NAME] . 
 After we receive the "" fatal - flaw "" desk - top analysis from ENSR ( Sept. 21 - 
 although I hope to get it sooner ) , I would offer that several events should 
 be scheduled to expedite the project as follows : 
 1 . If the open season reflects that we have a project and < ANON_NAME > approves , 
 a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
 project potential ( TNC , < ANON_NAME > Managing agencies , US < ANON_NAME > , 
 etc ) .   These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal - flaw 
 analysis . 
 2 . Simultaneously , we will begin working with ENSR ( if the open season 
 reflects that we have a project ) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
 Strategy for < ANON_NAME > ( this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
 soliciting bids for the < ANON_NAME > and permits ) . 
 3 . We will work with < ANON_NAME > and < ANON_NAME > to schedule a meeting with 
 the FERC Staff ( we need the commitment of the < ANON_NAME > < ANON_NAME > , 
 US < ANON_NAME > , etc . to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review ) to 
 introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
 early in the process . 
 4 . We will also need to develop a < ANON_NAME > and < ANON_NAME > 
 strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
 local , state , federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
 the right folks have a heads - up on the project before it hits the news 
 media .   This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
 project will formally be announced ( i.e. , news conference in Phoenix or 
 Houston , etc . ) .   A $ 580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
 area and for the Southwest . 
 I know there is more , but this will help to keep some of the early events 
 coordinated .   < ANON_NAME >"

 Subject : Re : california  
 Dave -- 
 To your direct question of should Enron take a more active role in supporting 
 or nominating Board members , I agree fully . 
 I would add the following thoughts : 
 First , I think that Enron 's key position in terms of ISO / RTO governance 
 should be that [NAME] ( or the leadership and staff of transmission providers ) 
 should be indifferent to the price at which the commodity trades .   ISOs and 
 RTOs should only worry about transmission , not the price of the commodity 
 they are transmitting .    Winning on this issue will be critical as RTOs are 
 proposed throughout the country to meet Order 2000 obligations .   
 < ANON_NAME > needs to really go after FERC for abdicating its wholesale market 
 authority to ISOs , especially ISOs like in California that are dominated by 
 state political figures .   FERC is responsible for ensuring just and 
 reasonable rates , not some stakeholder Board established by state 
 legislation .   We need to argue strongly that FERC must take back this 
 authority in the near term and utilize its administrative procedures to 
 impose any market changes .  
 Finally , given that it will be some period of time before there is truly a 
 "" financially indifferent "" transmission provider under Order 2000 , Enron must 
 take an active role in working within and through the Boards of the current 
 ISOs .    A good example is the way that < ANON_NAME > works within the 
 NE - ISO .   < ANON_NAME > and the ISOs are fundamentally political 
 organizations .   Our representatives must take the time to get to know the 
 people so that when key issues arise , we are able to influence the decisions .

 P.S. -- [NAME] , on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision .   See 
 Section 2 of the original contract , which gives TW the right to extend for 
 another five - year term by giving notice to SPS .   If TW does not give such 
 notice , SPS may cancel the contract , and if it does n't , the contract 
 automatically rolls over for another year .   If this is not acceptable please 
 let me know .

 What 's up ? I have mixed feeling about you going to 
 ND ... I ' , jealous ! This year is out for me 
 unfortunately .   I have some friends that have gone to 
 games this year ... I'll get the skinny on scalping .   It 
 should n't be much of a prop .   However , despite there 
 records , it 's still ND and Tennesse . It will be sold 
 out .   But you can get tix .   I know this much . You 
 ca n't ( or it 's against school policy to ) get tix on 
 campus . However , there are plenty of scalper on roads 
 leading to campus . 
 Sites to see .   Definietly check out the campus .   Make 
 time to see the lakes , go by the dome etc . It 's 
 awesome . Also , it may be one of the games of the 
 week ... so , look out for espn , nbc and all the rest . 
 The hype is great when networks other than nbc show . 
 Lots of small bars ... avoid the linebacker , unless you 
 want to test that you have the endurance you had in 
 undergrad . < ANON_NAME > Hall of Fame is 
 there ... downtown .   Tailgating is great .... like I said 
 make sure you get to the game early . That way you 'll 
 get the whole experience . Lots of tradition game day , 
 for example the Band marches from the dome to the 
 stadium .... it 's awesome . 
 I 'll give you a call at work ..

Message-ID: <26235337.1075860991693.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,<|original|>,"We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & < ANON_NAME > , so we want to update you on its status . 
 As many of you know , we have been working with members of the Creditors ' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & < ANON_NAME > , and we formally presented the plan to the committee on < ANON_NAME > 22 .   We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month . 
 We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & < ANON_NAME > may impact your decision to stay or to leave .   We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed .   We 're learning that , in bankruptcy , most things do n't move as quickly as we are accustomed . 
 The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan , but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns .   < ANON_NAME > ' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & < ANON_NAME > .   Such plans align the company 's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy .   These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate . 
 < ANON_NAME > ' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process .   To that end , we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee .   We intend to work hand - in - hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible .   This is currently our top priority , bar none ! 
 When we filed for bankruptcy , we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be .   Unfortunately , that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place . 
 We now know that it takes significant time , resources and effort to understand , identify and gather the massive volume of required details , to formulate that information into a reasonable program , and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation .   The process mirrors the most time - intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved .   That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse . 
 We remain committed to working with the Creditors ' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan .   We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so , and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court .   We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court . 
 With respect to non - debtor companies , or those companies not in bankruptcy , new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future . 
 In the meantime , we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week . 
 And of course , we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible ."

 20 % .   Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0 % to 20 % less than

Message-ID: <7625957.1075853094430.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,<|original|>,"As most of you already know , it has been a crazy weekend for some of us .   I 'm going to address why all this happened , what we have done , and the ongoing problems we are having ? 
 About 8 months ago < ANON_NAME > took a position on a curve called GD - AECOUSD - DAIL .   < ANON_NAME > he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD - AECOCD / FRWKD .   We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently [NAME] was not being captured on it .   It was not in the Primary / Secondary curve mapping table in [NAME] and was not mapped to an intra - month curve either ( OMICRON ) .  
 < ANON_NAME > evening I asked [NAME] to map the new curve in the primary /secondary table and [NAME] to map it to OMICRON_9 .   If this would have worked we expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx . $ 800 K given the risk structure of his positions .   But the desired results were not achieved .  
 < ANON_NAME > with the help of < ANON_NAME > and [NAME] we tried several different combinations of mappings with no positive results .   The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in < ANON_NAME > .   The book should be INTRA - ONTARIO - CAD2 .   It exists but , there are no positions in it .  
 The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it .   We need to find out why this is so ?   Understand also that AECOCD / FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it 's own but takes it from AECO - CDN / IM .   We have also mapped AECO - CDN / IM to CGPR - AECO / BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes .  
 < ANON_NAME > Virendra , and [NAME] have all worked very hard this weekend , despite having other work related commitments , to try to resolve this , and have gone over and above what was expected of them .   But despite all our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing .  
 [NAME] is very concerned about this because [NAME] is watching him .   I have to answer to him tomorrow and can not use systems issues as an excuse .   I want us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short - run fix Cuillas VaR.   We also want curve mapping to become a more front - end solution ( with very few users ) because of their ( the front office ) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped .   < ANON_NAME > will help us with this . 
 In the long - run I do n't want any of us to have to do this again and want to identify a solution .   Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take time and resources on his side .   Given the speed of the work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but , we have to find a way and , most of all be patient while we address these issues . 
 Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem .   Nilay we will need your expertise about curve mappings , and OMICRONS , for this ?  
 Thanks again for all your help this weekend .......

 [NAME] , we have come up with a structure that creates approx a C$ 45MM tax loss

Message-ID: <3498958.1075851631576.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,<|original|>,"Greetings : 
 Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th . 
 I 've read the respective [NAME] and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.   < ANON_NAME > language looks cleaner and simpler , though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language , too . 
 I 'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill .   I would appreciate your feedback .   The amendments would be as follows : 
 Customers who were on < ANON_NAME > when DWR started buying power ( Jan. 17th ? ) , and are still on < ANON_NAME > when the bill passes , should be exempt from paying for the bonds . 
 In short , customers should not be forced to pay for power twice -- once from their ESP , and once from DWR .   Since these customers receive power services from their ESP , they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it would n't be fair to require them to pay for it . 
 Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to < ANON_NAME > should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed , no more and no less .  
 For example , if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to < ANON_NAME > on May 1st , then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th . 
 I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4 - 5 weeks .   Or if we did n't explicitly agree during the talks , they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now . And rather than leave the issue hanging , which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers , I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers ' obligations are .   Your thoughts are appreciated . 
 In addition , we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in .   Providing ( 20KW and above ) customers with an incentive to switch to < ANON_NAME > as soon as possible could 1 ) reduce the net short position that the state ( and ultimately consumers ) have to finance , thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility ,   2 ) reduce electricity purchasing costs , and 3 ) reduce the burden on the state budget . 
 With this in mind , I 'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to < ANON_NAME > by September 1st . 
 Finally , it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend < ANON_NAME > is still in the bill .   If a dedicated rate component is created , that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend < ANON_NAME > .   And if that 's the case , would it make sense to delete that language from the bill ? 
 Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "" core / noncore "" proposal . 
 < ANON_NAME >"

 < ANON_NAME > , 
 Thanks again for meeting with me last week about ideas for saving money on 
 Enron 's videos . 
 You asked me whether or not our new "" Pro - Sumer "" field production equipment 
 can download directly into e - mail .   The answer is yes and no .   The camera has 
 a feature that will enable us to play back still pictures into e - mail or file 
 storage .   We do not , however , have technology that will enable us to download 
 moving video straight from the camera into a computer .   As far as we know , 
 you still need to encode video for computer applications .   Now that we know 
 that 's something you 're interested in doing , we 'll keep our eye on the 
 technology and let you know when it has been developed . 
 I talked with [NAME] about the ideas I presented to you , but have not yet 
 talked with < ANON_NAME > .   I 'm planning to send him an e - mail this afternoon . 
 I forgot to mention one thing to you about the "" creative piggybacking "" 
 money - saving idea :   using a contractor to coordinate / piggyback video shoots 
 is exactly what Microsoft does .   When we interviewed < ANON_NAME > in 
 January , we went to Microsoft 's facilities and used Microsoft 's crew .   Then 
 they invoiced us for a whopping $ 1800.00 ( for fewer than 15 minutes of 
 shooting time ) .  
 [NAME] , I hope that as your thoughts progress about Enron 's video needs , 
 you 'll consider me to be part of the team .   I would like to help develop and 
 be a part of the solutions .

 PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently .   Prior to 
 June they appeared to be using a market based price for power , but in June 
 the credit dropped to about $ 40 / MWh which looks like utility - owned gen . 
 We want to make sure we are not missing a utility - levied charge in our 
 forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA ) so we 're trying 
 to verify the utilities ' method of calculating PX credits . 
 I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their [NAME] group 
 has sent Enron 's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is 
 calculated .   Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon 
 as possible ?   Given that our customers are all switching to DA we do n't want 
 to discover there 's a charge we do n't know about .
